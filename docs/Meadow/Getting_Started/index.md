## A quick note before you get started

Hello there,

Meadow is a work in progress with new features and drivers being added all the time - there are a few important things
to note that will help you on your way with Meadow:

 1. It's worth checking out our [roadmap](/Meadow/Release_Notes/Roadmap/) and [release notes](/Meadow/Release_Notes/) to
 get an idea of which core Meadow features are complete and which are still being worked on.
 2. We maintain a handy list of [peripherals](/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/Peripherals/) with driver implementation
 status and links to code/circuit examples.
 3. Much of Meadow is open source - we welcome contributions via pull request to:
 * [Meadow.Foundation](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Foundation) - our GitHub repo for peripherals and drivers
 * [Documentation](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Documentation/tree/meadow_docs) - our GitHub repo for
 documentation. These docs that you're reading here can be found under
 [/docs](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Documentation/tree/meadow_docs/docs) and the class/peripheral
 code examples are under [/docfx/api-override](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Documentation/tree/meadow_docs/docfx/api-override).
 *Note that Meadow docs are kept on the `meadow_docs` branch.*
 4. We have a public [Slack channel](wildernesslabspublic.slack.com) - come say hi and show us what you're building! If
 you can't find the answers to any of your questions in these docs, ping us a message there and we'll do our best to
 help you out.
